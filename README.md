# Data-Analysis-Sample-Case-Study
This is a sample data analysis study I completed on my own as training using Python in conjunction with SQL. The data is open access, and the case problem was completely hypothetical. 
If you want to check the whole project, I recommend you start by Case Study Report.pdf, then head to methodology.ipynb for the more technical code. Be warned some cells may take several minutes to run, depending on your computerÂ´s processing capabilites. Lastly, you can check the results in Visualizations.pdf or you can head over to https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/luis.gonzalez6272/viz/Divvypublicdata2022/top_stations for an interactive visualization of the Chicago bike shar locations. 
I hope the code and results obtained may aid someone on their own data analysis journey. Cheers.
